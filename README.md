This crate provides several algorithms that implement highly accurate or even guaranteed correct
sum and dot product for floating-point numbers without resorting to arbitrary precision arithmetic.

## Usage

Add the `accurate` crate as a dependency in your `Cargo.toml`:

```toml
[dependencies]
accurate = "0.3"
```

Then use it in your program like this:

```rust
extern crate accurate;

use accurate::traits::*;
use accurate::sum::Sum2;

fn main() {
  let x = vec![1.0, 2.0, 3.0];
  let s = x.sum_with_accumulator::<Sum2<_>>();
  assert_eq!(6.0f64, s);
}
```
